### About me
I am a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working in the area of Machine Learning (ML) for healthcare advised by [Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/). Most of my research focusses on how to best use ML to estimate personalized causal effects of treatments, but I am broadly interested in many topics relating to causality, missing data, distribution shifts and statistical machine learning more generally. You can find a selection of my work under the Publications page or on [my Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eWRBqsYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). Please feel free to reach out in case you want to discuss with me! 

#### My professional background
Albeit a ML researcher today, I am an applied statistician at heart -- and most of my research therefore reflects my desire to connect ideas from applied statistics with machine learning. I hold a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research (_summa cum laude_) and a BSc in Economics and Business Economics (_summa cum laude_) with specialisation in Policy Economics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and a MSc in Statistical Science (with _distinction_ and [prize](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/gutierrez-toscano-prize) for top performance in the cohort) from the University of Oxford. I also briefly worked as a data scientist evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and as a research intern at [Pacmed](https://pacmed.ai/), a Dutch start-up bringing ML solutions to clinical practice. 

#### Me, personally
When not nerding out on stats and ML, I like to stay active. I've played waterpolo for 14 years (I earned half-blue status in both Oxford and Cambridge by representing both universities in some of the annual varsity matches) and -- like every other Oxbridge student -- have recently become infatuated with rowing & have therefore been women's captain of Clare Hall Boat Club (my college in Cambridge) in 2022 and am now responsible for running the club's social media. Occasionally, one may find me away from the water on a run or a hike. I am also always ready to binge-watch a good Netflix show and love good food & cooking.
