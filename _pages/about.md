## Alicia's personal academic website
Hi and welcome to my (Alicia Curth's) personal academic website!

### About me
I am a third year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working in the area of Machine Learning (ML) for healthcare advised by [Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/). Most of my research focusses on how to best use ML to estimate personalized causal effects of treatments, but I am broadly interested in many topics relating to causality, missing data and distribution shifts. You can find a selection of my work under the Publications page or on [my Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eWRBqsYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). Please feel free to reach out in case you want to discuss with me! 

#### My professional background
Albeit a ML researcher today, I am an applied statistician at heart -- and most of my research therefore reflects my desire to connect ideas from applied statistics with machine learning. I hold a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research (_summa cum laude_) and a BSc in Economics and Business Economics (_summa cum laude_) with specialisation in Policy Economics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and a MSc in Statistical Science (with _distinction_ and [prize for top performance in the cohort](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/gutierrez-toscano-prize)) from the University of Oxford. I also briefly worked as a data scientist evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and as a research intern at [Pacmed](https://pacmed.ai/), a Dutch start-up bringing ML solutions to clinical practice. 

#### Me, personally
When not nerding out on stats and ML, I like to stay active. I've played waterpolo for 14 years (I earned half-blue status in both Oxford and Cambridge by representing both universities in some of the annual varsity matches) and -- like every other Oxbridge student -- have recently become infatuated with rowing & am therefore currently women's captain of Clare Hall Boat Club (my college in Cambridge). Occasionally, one may find me away from the water on a run or a hike. I am also always ready to binge-watch a good Netflix show and love good food & cooking.
