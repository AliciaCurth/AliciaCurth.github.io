### About me
I am a Senior Researcher in Machine Learning at Microsoft Research Cambridge. Currently, I am interested in (re)building statistical intution for  modern ML methods and apparently elusive phenomena in deep learning -- such as double descent and the surprisingly good performance of models that would appear to be heavily overfitted -- as I strongly believe in the importance of demystification of the area. Most of my earlier research centered around how to best use ML to estimate personalized causal effects of treatments.  Overall, I am broadly interested in many topics relating to causality, missing data, distribution shifts and ``all of statistical machine learning''. You can find a selection of my work under the Publications page or on [my Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eWRBqsYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). Please feel free to reach out in case you want to discuss with me! 

#### My professional background
Albeit a ML researcher today, I am a statistician at heart -- and most of my research therefore reflects my desire to connect ideas from (applied) statistics with machine learning. I hold a BSc in Econometrics and Operations Research (_summa cum laude_) and a BSc in Economics and Business Economics (_summa cum laude_) with specialisation in Policy Economics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and a MSc in Statistical Science (with _distinction_ and [prize](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/gutierrez-toscano-prize) for top performance in the cohort) from the University of Oxford. Between 2020 and 2024, I completed a PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge, advised by Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar. Before starting the PhD, I also briefly worked as a data scientist evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and as a research intern at [Pacmed](https://pacmed.ai/), a Dutch start-up bringing ML solutions to clinical practice. 

#### Me, personally
When not thinking about stats and ML, I like to stay active. I played waterpolo for 14 years (I earned half-blue status in both Oxford and Cambridge by representing both universities in some of the annual varsity matches) and -- like every other Oxbridge student -- became infatuated with rowing during my student time. One may sometimes find me away from water on a run or a hike. I am also always ready to binge-watch a good Netflix show and love good food & cooking.
